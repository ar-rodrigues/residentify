# Project Goals

## Overview

A building access management system where organizations can manage residents, security personnel, and visitor access through QR codes.

## Core Features

### User Registration & Organization Management

- Users can register and create an organization
- Organization creators automatically receive the **Admin** role
- Admins can invite new users to their organization and assign roles

## Role Architecture

The system uses a **two-tier role system**:

### App-Level Roles

- **Purpose**: Control access to application-wide features
- **Scope**: Applies to the entire application
- **Examples**: `user`, `super_admin` (if needed)
- **Storage**: `profiles.role_id` references `roles.id`
- **Note**: A user has **one** app-level role

### Organization-Level Roles

- **Purpose**: Control access within specific organizations
- **Scope**: Applies only within a specific organization
- **Examples**: `admin`, `resident`, `security_personnel`
- **Storage**: `organization_members.organization_role_id` references `organization_roles.id` (table-based, not enum)
- **Note**: A user can have **different roles in different organizations**

### Multi-Organization Support

- Users can belong to **multiple organizations**
- Each organization membership has its own role
- A user can be an Admin in Organization A and a Resident in Organization B
- When accessing organization-specific features, the system checks the user's role **in that specific organization**

## User Roles

### App-Level Roles

#### 1. User (Default)

- **Who**: All registered users
- **Permissions**:
  - Access the application
  - Create organizations
  - Join organizations via invitation
  - Manage own profile

### Organization-Level Roles

#### 1. Admin (Organization-Level)

- **Who**: Organization creators and assigned admins
- **Scope**: Specific organization only
- **Permissions**:
  - Manage organization settings
  - Invite users to the organization
  - Assign/change roles to organization members
  - Remove members from organization
  - Full access to organization management
  - View all access logs for the organization

#### 2. Resident (Organization-Level)

- **Who**: People living in an apartment building
- **Scope**: Specific organization only
- **Permissions**:
  - Invite external visitors (people outside the app)
  - Generate QR codes for external visitors
  - View their own visitor history (QR codes they generated)
  - View access logs for their own QR codes

#### 3. Security Personnel (Organization-Level)

- **Who**: People responsible for securing the building entrance
- **Scope**: Specific organization only
- **Permissions**:
  - Scan QR codes of all users (residents, external visitors, etc.)
  - Register entries and exits
  - Monitor who enters and leaves the building
  - View all access logs for the organization
  - View visitor information on scan

#### 4. External Visitor

- **Who**: People invited by residents (not registered in the app)
- **Access**:
  - Receive one-time QR codes from residents
  - Use QR code to enter the building
  - QR code registers their entrance automatically
  - **Note**: Not a role, but a visitor type tracked via QR codes

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Organization Setup

1. User registers in the system → receives app-level role "user"
2. User creates an organization → automatically becomes **Admin** in that organization (organization-level role)
3. Admin invites users (Residents, Security Personnel) and assigns organization-level roles
4. Invited users can accept and join the organization with their assigned role
5. Users can belong to multiple organizations with different roles in each

### Flow 2: Resident Invites Visitor

1. Resident generates a QR code for an external visitor
2. External visitor receives the one-time QR code
3. Visitor presents QR code at entrance

### Flow 3: Access Control

1. Security Personnel scans QR code at entrance
2. System validates QR code and registers entry/exit
3. Access log is recorded with timestamp and visitor information

## Technical Requirements

- QR code generation for external visitors (one-time use)
- QR code scanning capability for Security Personnel
- Entry/exit logging system
- Two-tier role-based access control (RBAC):
  - App-level roles (user profile)
  - Organization-level roles (organization membership)
- Organization-based multi-tenancy
- Multi-organization support (users can belong to multiple organizations)
- Organization context switching (users select which organization they're working with)
